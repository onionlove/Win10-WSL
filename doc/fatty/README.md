FaTTY is the [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) Terminal emulator with tabs. It is
useful for Windows and Cygwin users who want powerful terminal.

FaTTY is based on [mintty](https://github.com/mintty/mintty). The main
difference to mintty is that you can run multiple session in single window
using tabs.

* Most features from mintty should work
* To create new tab, press ctrl-shift-T
* ctrl-shift-W closes the tab
* To change active tab, click it with mouse or press ctrl-(PagUp|PagDn)
* To move tab, press ctrl-shift-(PagUp|PagDn)

If you find bugs (there are probably many), you may report them on Github or
send pull requests

### Installing

To install, run cygwin setup\*.exe and have at least following packages marked for
install:

* gcc-g++
* make
* w32api-headers
* git

Then, in Cygwin terminal run following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/juho-p/fatty.git
    cd fatty
    make
    cp src/fatty.exe /bin
  
You can then try running it by typing `fatty`
  
Then you probably want to create shortcut to your Windows desktop to run fatty.
After that, you have decent terminal with tabs for your Cygwin!

To spawn a new tab, for example in a desktop shortcut, use `fatty -b "source $HOME/.bashrc; uname -a; exec bash"`.
You can spawn multiple tabs by providing `-b` option multiple times
(`fatty -b "commands for tab 1" -b "commands for tab 2" ...`). Always
execute bash (or other shell of your choice).

You might also want to remove the line `cd "${HOME}"` from `/etc/profile` (if
there are such line) if you want your new tabs to open same directory as your
current tab.
